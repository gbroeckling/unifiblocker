## How This Project Is Built

UniFi Blocker is built by [Garry Broeckling](https://github.com/gbroeckling).
Architecture, product decisions, testing, and releases are human-directed.
Implementation is AI-assisted using [Claude](https://claude.ai) by Anthropic.

If you contribute a PR, there is no requirement to use (or not use) AI tools.
Write code however you are most productive — what matters is that it works,
follows the existing patterns, and passes review.
